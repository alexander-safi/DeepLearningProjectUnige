Project 1 – Classification, weight sharing, auxiliary losses


The objective of this project is to test different architectures to compare two digits visible in a two-channel image. It aims at showing in particular the impact of weight sharing, and of the use of an auxiliary loss to help the training of the main objective.
It should be implemented with PyTorch only code, in particular without using other external libraries such as scikit-learn or numpy.




Project 2 – Mini deep-learning framework

The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only pytorch’s tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the neural-network modules.
